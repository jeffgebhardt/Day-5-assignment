// (Don't forget to create a new branch!) Write a function called sum() that takes in two numbers as arguments and then returns the sum of those numbers. Have it console.log() the numbers and the sum with a message that EXACTLY follows this example and uses the values that were input into the function:
//
// "The sum of 4 and 7 is 11."

function sum (x,y) {
  console.log('"The sum of ' + x + ' and ' + y + ' is ' + (x + y) + '"');
}
