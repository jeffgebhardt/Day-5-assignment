// Write a function called multiply() that takes in two numbers as arguments and then returns the product of those numbers. Have it console.log() the numbers and the product with a message that EXACTLY follows this example and uses the values that were input into the function:
//
// "The product of 4 and 7 is 28."

function sum (x,y) {
  console.log('"The sum of ' + x + ' and ' + y + ' is ' + (x + y) + '"');
}

function multiply(x,y) {
  console.log('"The product of ' + x + ' and ' + y + ' is ' + (x * y) + '"');
}
